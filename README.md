Hi there, I'm **mjfelis**.

I believe in decentralization, privacy, and digital autonomy. Surveillance has no place in a free internet. My work focuses on building technologies that return control to users, making the web more private, censorship-resistant, and trustless. Let’s rebuild the internet as it was meant to be: open, secure, and decentralized.

**mjfelis** comes from “*felis*”, the Latin word for cat: a symbol deeply associated with independence, privacy, and autonomy across cultures.

**🐾 Independence**: Cats are famously self-reliant. They operate on their own terms, making their own decisions, much like the ethos of decentralized systems.

**🛡️ Privacy**: Cats are discreet and elusive, often hiding or moving silently, traits akin to a strong preference for privacy in digital systems.

**🧷 Autonomy**: Cats aren’t easily trained or controlled, representing freedom from surveillance and centralized authority, values reflected in your work and beliefs.

In essence, “felis” signals a digital identity aligned with sovereignty and resistance to control.
